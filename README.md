```
## Acceptance Criteria

 #
 ## My Process
```
I started off by makeing  HTML files, one is for the main Quiz page. 
```

```
I also made an HTML to have for the scores when you click on the link
```
![getting started](assets/img/HTML%20Scroes%20.jpg)
```
Next I moved on to making some code for the CSS file this contains both CSS for the HTML Shown above.
```

![getting started](assets/img/css02.jpg)
![getting started](assets/img/css03.jpg)
```
Our site now look Better
```
![Main site](assets/img/Main%20Site.jpg)
![Highscores](assets/img/Scroe%20site.jpg)
```
Nows lets go make a JS file to get this site working!
I'll start off by making the questions!
```
![Main JS](assets/img/mainJS01.jpg)
![Main JS](assets/img/mainJS02.jpg)
![Main JS](assets/img/mainJS03.jpg)
![Main JS](assets/img/mainJS04.jpg)
![Main JS](assets/img/mainJS05.jpg)
```
the JS above allows the questions to be anwsered shows if its wrong or right and will track it
 as you go. At the end it will be able to take yo to the next page which we need to make another JS for the ScoreBoard!
```

```
In the end we come up with a full Quiz with tracking scores
